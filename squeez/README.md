# Huffman Coding:
- David huffman developed an algo. to find optimal prefix code. 
- "Prefix code" is a code system that is distinguished by the possesion of prefix property, which requires that there is no whole code word in the system that is a prefix (initial segment) of any other code word in the system. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefix_code)
# Data Compression:
- It is the process of encoding information that is using fewer bits than the original representation. 
- Compression can be lossy or lossless.
- A device that performs data compression is referred to as encoder
- And one that performs the reversal (decompression) is decoder
- The header is a part of the file that contains metadata, which describes key information about the file and the compression format. 

To Do:
- [] Inefficient algorithm (for large input files) needed improvement
- [] Decoding Function
